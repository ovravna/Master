abstract = "Anatomy teaching in terms of content and methodology has undergone major changes in the recent times due to time constraints, scarcity of cadavers, rapid advances in information technology, and changes in the demands of the medical profession. Moreover, there has been a major paradigm shift in medical education from passive, didactic, and teacher-centered approach to active, clinical-based, and student-centered approach. The debate on how to teach anatomy in the most effective way continues, and there is not yet a workable solution to integrate the two lines of thought (teacher-centered/student-centered) that can resolve the dispute between the two approaches. The present article therefore meta-analyses the role and effectiveness of various instructional modalities in teaching and learning anatomy in the context of the shifting paradigm from teaching to learning. The available literature on the use of various instructional strategies employed for teaching-learning anatomy suggests that the challenge should not be to determine superiority of one methodology over another but to capitalize on the learning benefits offered by the different methods. Learners should be provided opportunity to use multiple resources, thus favoring flexibility in the acquisition of knowledge. Proper amalgamation of traditional teaching methodologies such as lectures and dissection and the newer instructional methods, namely problem-based learning and computer-aided learning, would help to catalyze the shift from pedagogy to andragogy, where educators no longer serve chiefly as the dispensers of the subject content, but act as facilitators of learning and evaluators of competency. The net result should be to produce lifelong learners committed to continuous improvement of skills and knowledge."

  abstract={The impressive development of medical imaging technology during the last decades provided physicians with an increasing amount of patient specific anatomical and functional data. In addition, the increasing use of non-ionizing real-time imaging, in particular ultrasound and optical imaging, during surgical procedures created the need for design and development of new visualization and display technology allowing physicians to take full advantage of rich sources of heterogeneous preoperative and intraoperative data. During 90's, medical augmented reality was proposed as a paradigm bringing new visualization and interaction solutions into perspective. This paper not only reviews the related literature but also establishes the relationship between subsets of this body of work in medical augmented reality. It finally discusses the remaining challenges for this young and active multidisciplinary research community.},

abstract = {Although cadavers constitute the gold standard for teaching anatomy to medical and health science students, there are substantial financial, ethical, and supervisory constraints on their use. In addition, although anatomy remains one of the fundamental areas of medical education, universities have decreased the hours allocated to teaching gross anatomy in favor of applied clinical work. The release of virtual (VR) and augmented reality (AR) devices allows learning to occur through hands-on immersive experiences. The aim of this research was to assess whether learning structural anatomy utilizing VR or AR is as effective as tablet-based (TB) applications, and whether these modes allowed enhanced student learning, engagement and performance. Participants (n = 59) were randomly allocated to one of the three learning modes: VR, AR, or TB and completed a lesson on skull anatomy, after which they completed an anatomical knowledge assessment. Student perceptions of each learning mode and any adverse effects experienced were recorded. No significant differences were found between mean assessment scores in VR, AR, or TB. During the lessons however, VR participants were more likely to exhibit adverse effects such as headaches (25\% in VR P < 0.05), dizziness (40\% in VR, P < 0.001), or blurred vision (35\% in VR, P < 0.01). Both VR and AR are as valuable for teaching anatomy as tablet devices, but also promote intrinsic benefits such as increased learner immersion and engagement. These outcomes show great promise for the effective use of virtual and augmented reality as means to supplement lesson content in anatomical education.

abstract = {Abstract This article explores the potential learning benefits of three-dimensional (3-D) virtual learning environments (VLEs). Drawing on published research spanning two decades, it identifies a set of unique characteristics of 3-D VLEs, which includes aspects of their representational fidelity and aspects of the learner–computer interactivity they facilitate. A review of applications of 3-D VLEs is presented, leading to the identification of a series of learning affordances of such environments. These affordances include the facilitation of tasks that lead to enhanced spatial knowledge representation, greater opportunities for experiential learning, increased motivation/engagement, improved contextualisation of learning and richer/more effective collaborative learning as compared to tasks made possible by 2-D alternatives. The authors contend that the continued development of and investment in 3-D games, simulations and virtual worlds for educational purposes should be considered contingent on further investigation into the precise relationships between the unique characteristics of 3-D VLEs and their potential learning benefits. To this end, they conclude by proposing an agenda or ‘roadmap’ for future research that encompasses empirical studies aimed at exploring these relationships, as well as those aimed at deriving principles and guidelines to inform the design, development and use of 3-D virtual environments for learning.},
