\subsection*{Installation of Nevrolens}

This section will be a guide for installing Nevrolens on HoloLens 2 and Android from packages hosted on GitLab.
By following the instructions for HoloLens 2, this should also work for HoloLens 1, but has limited testing on that platform as it was not a focus of this research.
