\chapter{Testing}


This chapter will explore how testing has been accomplished in this research project, both day-to-day software testing, but also feedback from stakeholders and formal user testing. Because of the current COVID-19 pandemic, physical meeting and user testing been done sparingly, and have at times been impossible carry out, in fact the fall semester did not see any physical testing by users not affiliated with the VRLab at NTNU Dragvoll.

\section{Software testing}
During development, software testing has been done unstructured, mostly by way of regular deployment and on-device feature testing. This is admittedly not the most comprehensive testing system and can not guarantee intended behavior as systems are combined and restructured, in the same way as a test suit with \textit{unit testing} and \textit{integration testing} could. But it allows for more rapid development, less overhead for a single developer and can not be said to have meaningfully limited the research project. A case could be made for a testing suit being helpful in the continuation of the research as new developers will have a concrete indication of intended behavior, this has and could not have a high priority as a development goal, because of limitations in development time and the demand for creating a research result.
