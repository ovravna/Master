This study aims to explore whether Augmented Reality can be used as a tool for medical students learning neuroanatomy. A application, \textit{Nevrolens}, was created with features simulating a conventional rat brain dissection. While the results from this study are limited, the application has shown promise in its use as a virtual simulation of a rat brain dissection.
